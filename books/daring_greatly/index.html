<meta name="twitter:description" content="Daring Greatly by Brené Brown How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead
 What I find remarkable about this book is the unique combination of solid research and kitchen table story-telling. Brené becomes such a real person in the book that you can actually hear her voice asking, &ldquo;Have you dared greatly today?&rdquo; The invitation in this book is clear: We must be larger than anxiety, fear, and shame if we want to speak, act, and show up."/>

<p>What I find remarkable about this book is the unique combination of solid research and kitchen table story-telling. Brené becomes such a real person in the book that you can actually hear her voice asking, &ldquo;Have you dared greatly today?&rdquo; The invitation in this book is clear: We must be larger than anxiety, fear, and shame if we want to speak, act, and show up. The world needs this book and Brené’s unique blend of warmth, humor and ass-kicking makes her the perfect person to inspire us to dare greatly.— Harriet Lerner</p>
